It is an introductory course to oTree. No prior knowledge of Python
or any other programming language is necessary.

Install PyCharm (apply for Academic edition using your
university email address).

Try to install oTree, ideally into a `virtualenv`. If you can't I will
try to supply you with an access to a virtual environment on Amazon Cloud9
(although it is **not** guaranteed).

Please, open a free account on GitHub. Install github client from here:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

If you want to publish your oTree apps online, register at Heroku
and install Heroku CLI: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
